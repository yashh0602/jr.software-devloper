            <h3>The Brave Little Cat of Coral Cove</h3>
            <p>In the colorful seaside town of Coral Cove, a cheerful blue cat named Whiskers dreamed of becoming a hero
                like the ones he watched on his favorite show, The Adventures of Captain Star. Every afternoon, he tied
                a bright red towel around his neck as a cape and zoomed along the boardwalk on his squeaky skateboard.
                Most days, his “rescues” were small—helping baby turtles reach the ocean or returning dropped ice cream
                to giggling kids—but Whiskers treated each task like a top-secret mission.</p>
            <p>One breezy morning, excitement turned to trouble when a mischievous parrot named Mango snatched the grand
                prize ribbon from the annual Sandcastle Festival and flew toward the old lighthouse. The crowd gasped as
                the ribbon fluttered high above the beach. Determined to save the day, Whiskers remembered how Captain
                Star always used clever ideas instead of super strength. He scattered shiny seashells to distract Mango
                and used a trampoline near the beach gym to bounce high into the air, startling the parrot just enough
                to make him drop the ribbon safely onto the sand.</p>
            <p>By sunset, the festival sparkled brighter than ever, and Whiskers was cheered as Coral Cove’s smallest
                big hero. Though he didn’t have real superpowers, he discovered that courage and kindness were the
                greatest powers of all. As the sky turned pink and gold, Whiskers smiled proudly, ready for whatever
                adventure tomorrow might bring.
