                Every night at exactly 11:11, Mira’s old wall clock ticked twice instead of once. One evening, she noticed the clock’s hands moving to a time that hadn’t happened yet. The next day, everything the clock showed came true—rain, visitors, even a power cut. Afraid but curious, Mira waited for the final prediction. The clock stopped at 6:00. At 6:00 that evening, she finally chose to stop depending on it—and the clock never ticked again

                A lonely boy named Arin talked to the wind every afternoon on the hill. One day, the wind answered back, guiding him through forests and across fields. With the wind’s help, Arin delivered messages, helped farmers, and warned villagers of storms. Over time, Arin made many friends, and the wind grew quiet again. It had done its job—Arin was never lonely anymore.

                In a world of concrete, an old woman carried the last seed on Earth. People laughed when she planted it in a cracked sidewalk. Days passed, and nothing happened—until a small green sprout broke through the stone. Hope spread faster than roots, and soon the city worked together to grow gardens everywhere. One seed was enough to change everything.
